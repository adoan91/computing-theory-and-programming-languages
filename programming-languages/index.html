	<!--
	<p>(1) a brief self-introduction including name, email, interests and career goal. You should include one picture of yourself or your favorite things/objects.</p>
	-->

	<p>(1)<br/>My name is Anthony Doan, and I'm working on a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My interests consist of web development, fishing and video games. As for career goals I would like to get a job in game development or web development.<br/>

	<p>(2) a concise description of your programming languages knowledge and interests: make 2 or more lists to let us know which languages you know well, and which languages you want to learn more about and why.</p>
	-->

	<p>(2)<br/>Programming languages I know well are Java and C.<br/>
	Programming languages I want to learn more about are Javascript, PHP and MySQL because I want to work on databases and dynamic websites.</p>


	<!--
	<p>(3) Find and give a concise definition for each of the following terms regarding programming languages and post them at your website under PL Assignment 1:</p>
	-->

	<p>(3)<br/>PL Assignment 1:</p>

	<p>(a) Syntax: defines the formal relations between the constituents of a language, thereby providing a structural description of the various expressions that make up legal strings in the language.</p>

	<p>(b) Semantics: For programming languages, semantics describes the behavior that a computer follows when executing a program in the language.</p>

	<p>(c) Lexical scanning: is the process of scanning the stream of input characters and separating it into strings called tokens.</p>

	<p>(d) Parsing: (also known as syntax analysis) can be defined as a process of analyzing a text which contains a sequence of tokens, to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given grammar.<br/>
	(d) Parser: receives a string of tokens from the lexical analyzer and constructs a parse tree if the string of tokens can be generated by the grammar of the source language; otherwise, it reports the syntax errors present in the source string.</p>

	<p><h2>PL Assignment 3 Logical Programming</h2></p>
	<p>6. Exam problem contribution. Using the Example "Every scientist is logician" (see
		<br/>handout) as a guide, to create a problem with following 4 parts and then give solution to your own
		<br/>problem, Post your problem ((a) - (c)) and solution ((d) - (e)) at your website to share with your
		<br/>classmates. (Note: You may scan / take a picture of hand drawn deduction tree or draw it with a tool
		<br/>digitally)
	</p>
	<p>(a) Write a PROLOG representation of the following facts: (your at least 5 facts in English);</p>
	<p>likes(charlie, dankmemes). /*charlie likes dankmemes*/
		<br/>likes(anthony, alchemy). /*anthony likes alchemy*/
		<br/>likes(liza, pokemon). /*liza likes pokemon*/
		<br/>likes(charlie, pokemon). /*charlie likes pokemon*/
		<br/>likes(anna, pokemon). /*anna likes pokemon*/
	</p>
	<p>(b) Write a PROLOG representation of the following rule: (your at least 3 rules in English);</p>
	<p>memelord(X) :- likes(X, dankmemes). /*X is a memelord if X likes dankmemes*/
		<br/>alchemist(X) :- likes(X, alchemy). /*X is a alchemist if X likes alchemy*/
		<br/>trainer(X) :- likes(X, pokemon). /*X is a trainer if X likes pokemon*/
	</p>
	<p>(c) Write two PROLOG goal statements to search for answers: (also give 2 W questions in
		<br/>English), and at least one of your goal statements should be a conjunction of two subgoals:
	</p>
	<p>?- alchemist(X). /*who is a alchemist*//*answer = anthony*/
		<br/>?- likes(X, dankmemes), likes(X, pokemon). /*who likes dankmemes and pokemon*//*answer = charlie*/
	</p>
	<p>(d) Run each given query in (c) using Prolog and then post the interactive sessions as part
		<br/>of your solution at your website;
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/135hw3.png"></p>

	<p>(e) Show deduction tree that deducing the answer for one of the W questions above according
		<br/>to Prolog search strategy (a picture to post).

	<p><h2>PL Homework Assignment 4:</h2></p>
	<p>Web-based Recursive Descent Recognizer</p>
	<p>
	EXP    ::= EXP  + TERM   | EXP - TERM    | TERM
	<br/>TERM   ::= TERM * FACTOR | TERM / FACTOR | FACTOR
	<br/>FACTOR ::= ( EXP ) | DIGIT
	<br/>DIGIT  ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
	</p>
	<p>
	Assumptions: 
	<br/>- Assume the input stream is the token stream.
	<br/>- Assume the input stream terminates with a $.
	<br/>- Assume there is no white space.
	</p>
	<p>
	Example of some valid strings:
	<br/>1+2$
	<br/>0-3*2$
	<br/>2/(3+1)$
	</p>
	<p>
	Example of some invalid strings:
	<br/>1+2
	<br/>1*4$
	<br/>1*a$
	</p>
	<p>Enter string using the numbers 0 to 9, and the 
	<br/>symbols +, -, *, /, (, and ). 
	<br/>Your end of string variable will be dollar sign ($).
	<br/>When you click on 'Submit', it will check whether entered string is valid or not for a given grammar. </p>
	<p><strong>Enter an input string please.</strong></p>
	<p>
	<input type="text" id="input" >
	<button id="input-string""> Submit </button>
	</p>
	<p>
	(1) The language I chose for my RDR implementation was JavaScript. I chose JavaScript because it is considered a functional programming language like Scheme. After doing a tutorial for JavaScript I felt the language was easy to use.
	</br>(2) Useful learning resource I used for implementation: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript Tutorial</a>
	</br>(3) <a href="http://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~rdp135/rdr/rdr1.php">RDR reference used</a>
